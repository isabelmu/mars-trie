mars-trie is a port of Susumu Yata's marisa-trie from C++ to Rust.

The port is currently not in a working state, but should be up and running around the end of January 2016 or so. I'll try to match marisa-trie's performance and features, while add fuzzy (Levenshtein-distance-based) string matching support. I also hope to add other dictionary implementations.
